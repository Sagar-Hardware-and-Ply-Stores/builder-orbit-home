## File Structure for Vercel

```
â”œâ”€â”€ api/                    # Vercel serverless functions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ contact.ts         # Contact form API
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ demo.ts           # Demo API
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ping.ts           # Ping API
â”œâ”€â”€ client/               # React application source
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/spa/            # Built static files (generated)
â”œâ”€â”€ vercel.json          # Vercel configuration
â””â”€â”€ package.json         # Updated with vercel-build script
```

## Important Notes

1. **SPA Routing**: The `vercel.json` configuration handles client-side routing for React Router.

2. **API Routes**: Server functions have been converted to Vercel serverless functions in the `/api` directory.

3. **CORS**: API routes include CORS headers for cross-origin requests.

4. **Build Process**: The `vercel-build` script only builds the client-side application, as API routes are handled separately.

5. **Performance**: The build output shows bundle size warnings. Consider code splitting for better performance:
   ```bash
   # Optional: Analyze bundle
   npm run build:client -- --mode analyze
   ```

## Automatic Deployments

Once connected to a Git repository, Vercel will automatically:

- Deploy on every push to the main branch (production)
- Create preview deployments for pull requests
- Provide deployment previews with unique URLs

## Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain
4. Configure DNS records as instructed

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

- Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Ensure TypeScript types are correct
- Verify the build runs locally with `npm run vercel-build`

### API Routes Not Working

- Check that API files are in the `/api` directory
- Verify function exports are correct
- Check Vercel function logs in the dashboard

### Routing Issues

- Ensure `vercel.json` routing configuration is correct
- Check that React Router is properly configured
